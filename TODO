By Michael Schaller:
* Add license.

* Package the code for Debian/Ubuntu.
  - Build-Dependencies:
      pylint3,
      python3,
      python3-apt,
      python3-flake8,
      python3-nose,
      python3-nose-cov
  -Dependencies:
      python3,
      python3-apt
  - Entry points:
      purgatory.cli.main()

* Try to get rid of as many no cover statements as possible.

* Automatically generate documentation via Sphinx.  If possible add Sphinx to
  the linters to flag faulty documentation.

* Add README.md file with instructions for:
  - Build status (Travis)
  - Coverage status (Coveralls)
  - How to use
  - Link to documentation
  - License
  - Contributing
  - Testing
  - Linting
  - Building

* Add man page based on the README.md file.

* Improve command line interface:
  - leafs command:
    + Add option to not list (keep) certain packages.
    + Add option to get more information, like for an instance the short
      description of the packages, how many packages will be removed and the
      total size of the removed packages.
    + Add sort option to sort by name, number of removed packages, total size of
      removed packages, ... . This will probably force the use of the option to
      get more information.

  - purge command:
    + Allow to use regular expressions for package names.
    + Simulate if the Apt resolver would reach the same results as Purgatory.
      I the results differ then something might be wrong with Purgatory. A
      mismatch certainly needs to be investigated.
    + Use python-apt to purge the packages.
    + List the packages to be removed per layer. That hopefully makes it easier
      to grasp what is going.
    + Add option to only remove the packages instead of purging them.

  - Add graph command to render (parts of) the graph with the help of GraphViz.
