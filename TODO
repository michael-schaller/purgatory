MS:
* Add license.

* Package the code for Debian/Ubuntu.
  Build-Dependencies:
    pylint3,
    python3 >= 3.3,  # Tests rely on random ordering of dicts and sets.
    python3-apt,
    python3-astroid >= 1.3.6,  # 1.2.1 crashes on importing importlib.
    python3-nose2 > 0.5.0,  # Vivid's version can't collect import time.
    python3-nose2-cov > 1.0a4,  # Vivid's version can't collect import time.
    python3-flake8
  Dependencies:
    python3 >= 3.3,
    python3-apt

* Increase test coverage to 100% and set fail_under to 100% in coverage.cfg.
  I don't know if this is even possible with the monkey-patch module for python-
  apt but I can certainly try. fail_under is supported since python3-coverage
  3.7.2 and for an instance Ubuntu 15.04 doesn't support it.
  Furthermore nose2 can't collect import time coverage data before this commit:
  https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2/commit/79307722e58a6a5c62f1b8b06afd375c58e84a2a

* Automatically generate documentation via Sphinx.

* Add README.md file with instructions for:
  - Build status (Travis)
  - How to use
  - Link to documentation
  - Link to Slack
  - License
  - Contributing
  - Testing
  - Linting
  - Building

* Upstream python-apt patches. Once all patches are upstream and no old
  python-apt versions are left that need to be supported remove the mppa
  module.

* Try to get rid of as many no cover statements as possible.
